This repository contains the Genesis files used for our public TestNet. The latest version will always be updated and available in [latest](https://github.com/unification-com/testnet/tree/master/latest).  

## About TestNet

TestNet is our public Mainchain testing network. It is where new software features and processes are publicly tested, in addition to being a sandbox for developers who wish to test their WRKChains/BEACONs prior to deployment on MainNet.

**Important**: In order to test new functionality and processes, TestNet may be rebuilt and redeployed from the ground up.  

Past genesis files will be placed in directories according to version numbers outside of `latest` for development and testing purposes.
